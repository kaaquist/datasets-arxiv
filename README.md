# Data set maker
> data set maker - using arxiv to make a dataset 

This here is created because I found out it is possible to use a python lib called `arxiv`.
Over the year I have been reading papers from arxiv - so when I found out I could "browse"
the papers and articles using a python library - wow - I had too.

TODO:  
- [ ] Add better handling of storage - cloud storage.
- [ ] Add ability to get content from PDFs
